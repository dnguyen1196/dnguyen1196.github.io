## Bayesian Active Drug Discovery (Workshop on Real-world Medical Applications of ML @ ICML 20')

Abstract: We combine graph neural networks with Gaussian Process regression through deep graph kernel learning and demonstrate its robustness on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling tasks. Equipped with such a model, a Bayesian optimization experiment on chemical space is conducted and compared against the time-stamped acquisition records of a real-world, time-sensitive molecular optimization mission: the identification of potent inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, the viral pathogen responsible for the COVID pandemic.

## Differentially Private Spectral Ranking

Abstract: Spectral ranking is a popular approach to rank aggregation, wherein the preferences or choices of several individuals are aggregated to produce an overall ranking of alternatives. However, in many applications -- including for example recommender systems and elections -- privacy of individuals' choice data is a key concern. Unfortunately, standard spectral ranking algorithms are not designed with this concern in mind. In this paper, we propose a simple fix: we suggest using a randomized response mechanism to collect individuals' choice data. By design, the resulting private spectral ranking algorithm achieves the strong guarantees of local differential privacy, which in turn also leads to a global differential privacy guarantee. We quantify the privacy-utility tradeoff of our algorithm under the popular multinomial logit (MNL) choice model -- which has also been used to analyze previous spectral ranking algorithms -- by deriving a sample complexity bound that makes the dependence on the privacy parameter explicit. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets corroborate our analysis.

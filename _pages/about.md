Hi there, I'm Duc. I'm a Ph.D. student at the department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. My research is on machine learning, with a focus on ranking models.

My advisor is Prof. [Shivani Agarwal](https://www.shivani-agarwal.net/). Before Penn, I did my BS in Computer Science at Tufts University where I worked with [Shuchin Aeron](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/~shuchin/), [Mike Hughes](https://www.michaelchughes.com/) and [Roni Khardon](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/rkhardon/).
